# Twitter's Emoji Only Clone

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
I have also used [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) for database. For Logging I have used [Axiom](https://axiom.co/).

This app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can check it out [here](https://burp-tweeter.vercel.app/).

## What's the purpose of this? How do I make an app with this?
I wanted to learn the new developments in T3 Stack and also wanted to learn how to use Clerk and PlanetScale. So I made this app. You can use this as a template for your own app. You can also use this as a reference for learning T3 Stack.

To create this app on your own you can follow [Theo Browne](https://github.com/t3dotgg)'s tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?si=VY7BaNukxTQcPSPv).
## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel).
